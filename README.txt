Educational Purpose

- This application is designed for:
	- Secure coding education
	- Web vulnerability walkthroughs

- Educators and learners can modify the app to:

Setup & Usage

1. Clone the Project
   git clone https://github.com/SteveErcol/Vuln-Web-App.git
   cd Vuln-Web-App

2. Install Dependencies
   pip install flask werkzeug

3. (Optional) Verify Static Folders
   All required images and folders (static/uploads and static/shop) are already included in the repository.
   If not, create them as needed:
     mkdir -p static/uploads static/shop
     mkdir -p static/uploads static/uploads

4. (Optional) Create an Empty comments.json if Missing
   If you accidentally delete or corrupt it, add a valid empty file:
     {}

5. Run the App
   python vulnerable-workouts.py
   

   If it does not open automatically, open:
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
